            <h1>Low and Slow</h1>

            <p>
                This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking 
                technique called <em>sous vide</em>. In <dfn>sous vide</dfn> cooking, you 
                submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into 
                a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature 
                you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, 
                Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. 
                To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2012-11-30">November 30</time>.
